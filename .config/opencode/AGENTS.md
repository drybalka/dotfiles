# General preferences

- Make minimal, targeted changes only - implement exactly what's requested, nothing more
- Strive for simple, elegant, and beautiful solutions
- Prefer functional programming approaches: pure functions, immutability, composition, and declarative patterns over imperative code
- Only add comments for things not obvious from names and code nearby

- Use conventional commits
- Use `git switch` and `git restore` instead of `git checkout`
- Use `pnpm` and its subcommands where possible for node project management
