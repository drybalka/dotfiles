# Agent Instructions for Empty Directory

This is an empty or minimal project directory. When the user asks questions:

- Answer them generally and conversationally
- Do NOT search for files, codebase patterns, or repository conventions
- Do NOT use the Task tool to explore the non-existent codebase
- Only use file tools (Read, Glob, Grep) when explicitly asked to work with specific files
- Treat questions as general knowledge queries unless the user specifically requests file operations

Focus on providing direct, helpful answers rather than attempting to gather context from a codebase that doesn't exist yet.
